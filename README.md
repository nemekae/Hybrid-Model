Title: Hybrid Graph + NLP Models for Insurance Fraud Detection

I want to develop a  Hybrid Graph + NLP Models for Insurance Fraud Detection that combines graph-based anomaly detection with NLP-based text analysis to improve fraud detection accuracy and provide interpretable insights for investigators.

My objectives are to: 

Construct a fraud detection pipeline integrating graph features, tabular data, and claim text embeddings.
Compare the performance of tabular-only, graph-only, and hybrid fusion models.
Visualize suspicious claim networks to support human investigators.
Deliver a prototype that balances accuracy, interpretability, and practical feasibility.

Give me a simplified, summarized and step by step approach to achieve this. Use any available public data set to show the step by step approach for this. Treat each objective as a unique item in a stepwise manner.
